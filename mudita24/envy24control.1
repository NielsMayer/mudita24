.SH "NAME"
envy24control \- GUI control tool for Envy24 (ice1712) based
soundcards, under ALSA.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
\fBenvy24control\fP allows control of the digital mixer, channel gains and
other hardware settings for sound cards based on the ice1712 chipset (
http://alsa.cybermirror.org/manuals/icensemble/envy24.pdf ).  It also
displays a level meter for each input and output channel and maintains peak
level indicators.  This utility is preferable to \fBalsamixer(1)\fP for
those with ice1712-based cards: M-Audio Delta 1010, Delta 1010LT, Delta
DiO 2496, Delta 66, Delta 44, Delta 410 and Audiophile 2496. TerraTec EWS 88MT,
EWS 88D, EWX 24/96, DMX 6Fire, Phase 88.  Hoontech SoundTrack DSP 24,
SoundTrack DSP 24 Value, SoundTrack DSP 24 Media 7.1.  Event Electronics
EZ8.  Digigram VX442.  Lionstracs, Mediastaton.  Terrasoniq TS 88.  Partial
support for Roland/Edirol DA-2496.

[\fI\-o\fP 0\-num DACs max 8] [\fI\-i\fP 0\-num ADCs max 8] [\fI\-p\fP
0\-8] [\fI\-s\fP 0\-2] [\fI\-f\fP <profiles file name>] [\fI\-v\fP]

.TP 
If no control\-name is given, then the first sound card is used.

.SS Options
.TP 
\fI\-c\fP, \fI\--card\fP
Use the card specified by card\-number rather than the first card.
This is equivalent with \fI\-Dhw:n\fP option where \fIn\fP is the card
number. May also use the card name, e.g. \fI\-cM66\fP .
.TP 
\fI\-D\fP, \fI\--device\fP
Use the card specified by control\-name rather than the first card,
normally this will be of the form hw:\fIn\fP where \fIn\fP is the sound
card number (zero\-based). May also use the card name, e.g. \fI\-Dhw:M66\fP .
This is only needed if you have more than one Envy24\-based card or 
if your Envy24 card is not configured as the first card in your ALSA driver setup.
.TP 
\fI\-o\fP, \fI\--outputs\fP
Limit number of analog line outputs to display.  Default is the number of
DACs in the driver specification. Maximum is 8.
The number of analog output lines can only be reduced from the available
number of output lines.
.TP 
\fI\-i\fP, \fI\--inputs\fP
Limit number of analog line inputs to display.  Default is the number of
ADCs in the driver specification. Maximum is 8.
The number of analog input lines can only be reduced from the available
number of input lines.
.TP 
\fI\-p\fP, \fI\--pcm_outputs\fP
Limit number of PCM outputs to display.  Default is 8.
.TP 
\fI\-s\fP, \fI\--spdif\fP
Limit number of SPDIF inputs/outputs to display.  Default is 2.
.TP 
\fI\-f\fP, \fI\--profiles_file\fP
File to read/write the alsactl settings.
If is not given DEFAULT_PROFILERC or for restore if DEFAULT_PROFILERC
doesn't exists SYS_PROFILERC will be used.
.TP 
\fI\-v\fP, \fI\--view_spdif_playback\fP
View spdif playback channels in the mixer.
It is not possible to manage something (muting, volume levels).
It is only to view the levelmeters.
Default is no view of spdif playback channels in the mixer.
.TP 
\fI\-m\fP, \fI\--midichannel\fP
Use MIDI controller values to control the Faders in the mixer view.
The application will react to controllers on channel midi\-channel and
send controllers on this channel when the user moves the GUI sliders.
.TP 
\fI\-M\fP, \fI\--midienhanced\fP
Use an enhanced mapping from midi controller values to db sliders.
.TP
\fI\-w\fP, \fI\--window_width\fP
Specify the initial width of the envy24control window.
Using window\-width in the range 0\-20 specifies approx number of mixer channels visible.
Values >20 are interpreted as screen pixels.
.TP
\fI\-t\fP, \fI\--tall_equal_mixer_heights\fP
Using \fI\-t1\fP enlarges the channel mixers to the same height as the digital mixer.
With values >1 the height of all mixers is increased in stages.
.TP
\fI\-n\fP, \fI\--no_scale_mark\fP
Disable scale marks, which may be incorrect on certain cards (?), or whose
Gtk-detent at the mark position may be annoying.
.TP
\fI\-g\fP, \fI\--channel_group_modulus\fP
Defaults to '2', which causes the application to pair input and output
channels labeled scale marks to Left/Right sides - this behavior occurs in
"Monitor Inputs" "Monitor PCMs" and "Analog Volume" panels. Should this
behavior be inappropriate for 4, 5.1, 7.1, 8.1 and ambisonic setups: Using
\fI\-g1\fP causes all channels to look the same. Other values up to the
card's maximum number of input or output channels may produce layouts
helpful for grouping channels.
.TP
\fI\-l\fP, \fI\--lights_color\fP
Defaults to 'dodgerblue' or '#1e90ff'. Set to a different color to change
the foreground color of the meters.
.TP
\fI\-b\fP, \fI\--bg_color\fP
Defaults to '#304050'. Set to a different color to change the background
color of the meters.

.SH "AUTHOR"

\fBenvy24control\fP is originally by Jaroslav Kysela <perex@perex.cz>.
with layout changes by SÃ¸ren Wedel Nielsen, and volume control code by
Takashi Iwai. 

Options \fI\-w\fP and \fI\-t\fP added Alan Horstmann
<gineera@aspect135.co.uk>.

(Summer 2010) NPM: (1) Implemented "Peak Hold" functionality in meters;
reimplemented meters to do away with inefficient "faux LED" peak-meter
display, which causes thousands of rectangles per-second to be drawn,
individually, for no good reason other than increasing the load. (2)
Significantly reduced the number of timer interrupts generated by this
program by slowing down all updates to 10 per second -- previously meters
updated 25x/second! (3) All volumes are represented as decibels, including
the 0 to -48dB range of the hardware peak-meters, the 0 -to- -48dB&off
attenuation for all inputs to the digital mixer, the 0 -to- -63dB
attenuation of the analog DAC, and the +18 -to- -63dB
attenuation/amplification of the analog ADC. (4) All gtk "scale" widgets
have dB legends; the "PageUp" "PageDown" keys allow rapid movement between
the marked levels, and "UpArrow" and "DownArrow" allow fine-adjustment.
(5) Added command-line options \fI\--no_scale_mark\fP,
\fI\--channel_group_modulus\fP, \fI\--lights_color\fP and \fI\--bg_color
options\fP; fixed \fI\--card\fP and \fI\--device\fP to allow valid ALSA
card and CTL device names (
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=602900 ).  (6) Add display of
"Delta IEC958 Input Status" under "Hardware Settings."
